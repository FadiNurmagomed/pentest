**What is the CIA Triad?** 

It is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization. The CIA triad has three components:

* Confidentiality - This means that only authorized users and processes should be able to access or modify data.
* Integrity - Integrity means that data can be trusted. Data should be maintained in a correct state, kept so that it may not be tampered with, and should be correct, authentic and reliable.
* Availability - Quite simply means that networks, systems, applications are up and running. It ensures that authorized users have timel, reliable access to resources when they are needed.
